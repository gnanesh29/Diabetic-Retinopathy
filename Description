Early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a serious consequence of diabetes, is essential to avoid vision loss. Traditional methods for detecting diabetic retinopathy frequently rely on comprehensive image analysis, which results in computing inefficiencies and drawn-out diagnostic procedures. In this project, we provide an innovative approach that shifts the spotlight from entire retinal images to 28x28 pixel sub-images while using the capabilities of machine learning and deep learning. 
Our research is driven by the hypothesis that by focusing mainly on the most relevant and noticeable portions of retinal images, diabetic retinopathy diagnosis can be accomplished with a substantially lower computational complexity. We propose that independent, sparse features that are collected from smaller regions that are significant can help to classify diabetic retinopathy more effectively and accurately. 
We offer two methods when it comes to detecting diabetic retinopathy. In order to build classifiers based on the retrieved important and sparse features from 28x28 pixel regions, we first use machine learning techniques including decision trees, and random forests. The potential of complex feature extraction is then utilized for comprehensive analysis using deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks. Our approach, which focuses on independent aspects, not only produces an effective and quick diagnosis but also maintains a high level of accuracy. 
The experimental outcomes demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and highlight its potential for affordable and immediate diabetic retinopathy screening. Our method can be used in situations with limited resources, such as mobile healthcare applications, by reducing computational requirements and memory utilization. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance diabetic retinopathy early identification, ultimately boosting the quality of life for those who have this crippling condition.
