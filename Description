Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to diabetic retinopathy, a serious condition that can cause vision loss. Utilising convolutional neural network (CNN) designs is necessary for the timely detection of retinopathy, helping to lower diagnosis expenses due to its time-consuming nature. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that enables accurate classification of even low-resolution retinal images. To identify the optimal image size, we initially applied the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the image. When we apply 2D FFT to the image, we get the amplitude and phase of the image. Using the amplitude and phase of the image, we plot a sinusoidal waveform. After resizing the image, we applied 2D FFT to the resized image to get the amplitude and phase of the image. Using the amplitude and phase of the image, we plotted the sinusoidal waveform to check whether the signal generated by the original image and the reduced image are the same. On the image, we have also applied the Nyquist frequency; if the pixel pitch of the resized image is twice or greater than the original image pixel pitch, then we can resize the image. While resizing the image, we should also handle the jagged edges; to overcome this, we have used the Gaussian blur. By using the above methods, we have identified the optimal image size as 28*28 pixels, which generates the same sinusoidal waveform as the original image. We have also examined the further reduction of the image and the generation of the sinusoidal waveform signal. On the image size of 28*28 pixels, we applied a modified version of DenseNet and ResNet and achieved accuracies of 78.33% and 80.34%, respectively. On a 14*14 image size for the modified DenseNet and ResNet, we achieved accuracies of 76.71% and 74.91%, respectively.
